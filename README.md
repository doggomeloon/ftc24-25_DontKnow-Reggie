# FTC 2024-2025: DontKnow/Reggie
Hello anyone reading this! :) This repository contains the program files for Berean Christian High School's Robotics Club (team 4998) for the years 2024-2025. This is uploaded by Nathaniel Greisen, the (now former) president of the robotics club. 

Throughout the course of this team's season, our team put in a ton of hard work, and though we didn't make it as far as we had hoped, I am incredibly proud of everyone who put their heart and soul into this robot, and I am so thankful to have spent 4 years with this team. Special thanks to all of the seniors: Benny, Ethan C., and Kurtis, our lead builder and my assistant coder: Robert and Ethan S., and finally, our amazing coaches: Mr. Peacock and Mrs. Hollenbeck. Without all of you, none of this would have happened. Anyways, I'm going to stop yapping and explain each file, hopefully I'll see some of you next year (talking to you Ethan S.)
